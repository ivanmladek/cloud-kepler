## Description of files in SIM_LC package. ##

bls_vec_simulator = Vectorized box-shape lightcurve simulator written by Andrea Zonca.  This is used in the Unit Test for testing the bls_pulse algorithms.

drive_make_lc = Wrapper around make_lc.py to create artificial lightcurves.  This can be used to test the entire pipeline chain and/or to run completeness tests.

make_lc = Main program to create artificial lightcurves.  Can be extended to make increasingly complex simulated lightcurves to run sensitivity and completeness tests.

quarter_timetables = Sub-directory containing text files that store observing times for each Quarter, based on the actual observing times of Kepler 16, which happened to be observed in long-cadence mode in every Quarter.
