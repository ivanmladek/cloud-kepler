## Description of files in SIM_LC package. ##

OLD/ = Directory with some older code for posterity, none of these routines should be actively used, and some of them are incomplete / abandoned part way through development.

__init__.py = File that allows modules in this directory to be run from outside here, even if not in the user's PYTHONPATH, e.g., python -m sim_lc.test_bls_pulse.

bls_vec_simulator = Vectorized box-shape lightcurve simulator written by Andrea Zonca.  This is used in the Unit Test for testing the bls_pulse algorithms.

quarter_timetables = Sub-directory containing text files that store observing times for each Quarter, based on the actual observing times of Kepler 16, which happened to be observed in long-cadence mode in every Quarter.

test_bls_pulse = The Unit Test for the bls_pulse algorithm.  Drives "bls_vec_simulator".
