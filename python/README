## Description of python modules and other files here. ##

bls_pulse = The bls_pulse main program that runs the algorithm on an input lightcurve.

bls_pulse_vec = A vectorized version of bls_pulse being developed in parallel to bls_pulse.py.

download = Retrieves FITS files from MAST, downloads them into memory, and extracts lightcurve information.

drive_bls_pulse = Driver program for bls_pulse.py for handling command-line options, etc.

join_quarters = Given a set of Kepler IDs and data from various Quarters, combines each Kepler ID's data into a continuous lightcurves.  Does not attempt any sophisticated Quarter stitching (no offsets applied, just does a grouping)

sandbox/ = Directory where users can play with software out-of-the-way.  Organized by user name.

sim_lc/ = Directory containing the simulation software for creating artificial lightcurves, running Unit Tests andd/or completeness tests, etc.
