Place tools useful for running remotely here. Currently, ``setup.sourceme`` will 
create a virtualenv Python with all the ``cloud-kepler`` dependencies and
activate it; the virtualenv can be re-used in later sessions.

Another tool in this directory, ``fetchall.sh``, will perform a fetch on all
available git branches and set up tracking correctly. This is sometimes useful
on remote systems but may not be necessary.
